This repository contains the resolution of exercises for the Advanced Algorithms Lab course, coded in C++. 

The exercises aim to improve advanced algorithm skills and emphasize algorithm design paradigms and problem solving treatment, including data structures, trees and graphs, string processing, arithmetic and algebra, combinatory analysis, number theory, sorting, and greedy algorithms. The ultimate goal is to develop group work and learn the International Collegiate Programming Contest format and dynamics.
